To make your PHP package (`my-php-package`) usable for other people, you can follow these steps to prepare and distribute it:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Distribute Your PHP Package

#### Step 1: Publish Your Package

1. **Version Control**: If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository in your project directory (`my-php-package/`):

   ```bash
   cd my-php-package
   git init
   ```

2. **Commit Your Code**: Add and commit your package code to the repository:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

3. **GitHub (Optional)**: If you want to make your package publicly accessible, push your code to a repository on GitHub or another hosting service:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <remote-repository-url>
   git push -u origin master
   ```

#### Step 2: Document Your Package

1. **README**: Create a `README.md` file in your project directory (`my-php-package/`) to explain what your package does, how to install it, and how to use it. Include examples and any prerequisites:

   ```markdown
   # My PHP Package

   This is a PHP package that provides utilities for ...

   ## Installation

   You can install this package via Composer:

   ```bash
   composer require your-vendor-name/my-php-package
   ```

   ## Usage

   ```php
   require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

   use MyPackage\ClassA;
   use MyPackage\ClassB;
   use MyPackage\ClassC;

   $classA = new ClassA();
   echo $classA->doSomething() . "\n";

   // More examples...
   ```

   ## Contributing

   Contributions are welcome. Please submit issues or pull requests.
   ```

2. **License**: Include a `LICENSE` file in your project directory to specify how your package can be used by others.

#### Step 3: Publish Your Package (Composer)

If you want your package to be installable via Composer, you can publish it on Packagist:

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/) if you haven't already.

2. **Publish on Packagist**:
   - Visit [Packagist](https://packagist.org/) and log in.
   - Click on "Submit" at the top right.
   - Enter the GitHub repository URL of your package and follow the instructions.

#### Step 4: Install and Use Your Package

Users can now install and use your package in their PHP projects via Composer:

1. **Installation**: In their PHP project directory, users can run:

   ```bash
   composer require your-vendor-name/my-php-package
   ```

2. **Usage**: Users can include and use your package in their PHP scripts as demonstrated earlier:

   ```php
   require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

   use MyPackage\ClassA;

   $classA = new ClassA();
   echo $classA->doSomething() . "\n";
   ```

### Summary

By following these steps, you make your PHP package (`my-php-package`) accessible and usable for others. Documenting your package well and publishing it on platforms like GitHub and Packagist helps others discover, install, and integrate your package into their PHP projects easily. This approach fosters collaboration, contributions, and broader use of your package within the PHP community.
