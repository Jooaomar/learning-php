"declare" is a construct in PHP that allows you to set compilation and execution directives for the script or for a specific block of code. One of the most common directives used with `declare` is `strict_types`, which enforces strict type checking for function arguments and return values.

Here is an example of how `declare` can be used with `strict_types`:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

function add(int $a, int $b): int {
    return $a + $b;
}

echo add(5, 10); // Works perfectly
echo add(5, '10'); // Causes a type error
?>
```

In this example, `declare(strict_types=1);` instructs PHP to use strict type checking for the code that follows. This means that if you try to pass a value that does not match the expected type (such as a string instead of an integer), PHP will generate an error instead of automatically converting the types.

Another directive that can be used with `declare` is `ticks`. The `ticks` directive allows you to define a block of code that will be executed every N instructions. Here is an example of how this can be used:

```php
<?php
declare(ticks=1);

function tick_handler() {
    echo "Tick handler called\n";
}

register_tick_function('tick_handler');

$a = 1;
$b = 2;

$a += $b;
$b += $a;
?>
```

In this example, the `tick_handler` function will be called after each instruction, thanks to the `declare(ticks=1);` directive. This can be useful for debugging or inserting periodic checks into your code.

In summary, `declare` is a powerful construct in PHP that allows you to control certain aspects of script execution, such as type checking and the execution of specific functions at regular intervals.

# Examples of Using declare(ticks=1);

Sure, let's consider a practical example where `declare(ticks=1);` is used to implement periodic checks or monitoring in a PHP script.

Imagine you have a script that needs to monitor memory usage during its execution. You can use `declare(ticks=1);` to call a memory check function after each instruction.

Here is an example of how this can be done:

```php
<?php
declare(ticks=1);

function memory_usage_handler() {
    echo "Memory usage: " . memory_get_usage() . " bytes\n";
}

// Register the memory usage check function
register_tick_function('memory_usage_handler');

function heavy_computation() {
    $arr = [];
    for ($i = 0; $i < 100000; $i++) {
        $arr[] = $i;
    }
    echo "Heavy computation completed\n";
}

// Execute the heavy computation function
heavy_computation();
?>
```

In this example:

1. `declare(ticks=1);` instructs PHP to execute the function registered with `register_tick_function` after each instruction.
2. The `memory_usage_handler` function is registered as the tick function using `register_tick_function('memory_usage_handler');`.
3. Inside the `heavy_computation` function, an array is filled with numbers from 0 to 99999, simulating a heavy computation task.
4. With each instruction inside the `for` loop, the `memory_usage_handler` function is called, printing the current memory usage.

When you run this script, you will see the memory usage displayed after each iteration of the loop, allowing you to monitor how memory usage increases during the execution of the heavy task.

This technique can be useful for debugging, performance monitoring, or implementing periodic checks in complex PHP scripts.


# memory_usage_handler

The `memory_get_usage` function in PHP is used to return the amount of memory, in bytes, that is being used by the script at the time the function is called. This function is very useful for monitoring and debugging memory usage in PHP applications, especially in scripts that process large volumes of data or perform memory-intensive operations.

### Examples of Using `memory_get_usage`

#### Basic Example

Here is a basic example of how to use `memory_get_usage`:

```php
<?php
// Shows the amount of memory used by the script at the start
echo "Memory used at the start: " . memory_get_usage() . " bytes\n";

// Creates an array with 10000 elements
$array = range(1, 10000);

// Shows the amount of memory used after creating the array
echo "Memory used after creating the array: " . memory_get_usage() . " bytes\n";

// Frees the array
unset($array);

// Shows the amount of memory used after freeing the array
echo "Memory used after freeing the array: " . memory_get_usage() . " bytes\n";
?>
```

#### Example with Monitoring Function

Let's see an example where we monitor memory usage at regular intervals using `declare(ticks=1)` and `memory_get_usage`:

```php
<?php
declare(ticks=1);

function memory_usage_handler() {
    echo "Memory usage: " . memory_get_usage() . " bytes\n";
}

// Registers the memory usage monitoring function
register_tick_function('memory_usage_handler');

function heavy_computation() {
    $arr = [];
    for ($i = 0; $i < 10000; $i++) {
        $arr[] = str_repeat('x', 100); // Creates large strings to increase memory usage
    }
    echo "Heavy computation completed\n";
}

// Executes the heavy computation function
heavy_computation();
?>
```

### Function Parameters

`memory_get_usage` can accept an optional parameter:

- `true`: Returns the real memory usage of the system, including the PHP overhead.
- `false` (default): Returns the amount of memory used by the script itself, excluding the system overhead.

Example:

```php
<?php
echo "Memory used by the script: " . memory_get_usage() . " bytes\n";
echo "Real memory used by the system: " . memory_get_usage(true) . " bytes\n";
?>
```

### Importance of Memory Monitoring

Monitoring memory usage is crucial in applications that process large volumes of data or need to maintain stable performance over time. Excessive memory usage can lead to performance issues or even system failures, so it's important to understand how and where memory is being used.

I hope this clarifies what `memory_get_usage` is and how you can use it in your PHP scripts!
